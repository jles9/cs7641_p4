### CS 7641 Project : Markov Decision Processes

# Github Link:
https://github.com/jles9/cs7641_p4

## Overview
This project seeks to conduct a suvery of reinforcement learning algorithims, including:
    Value iteration
    Policy Iteration
    Q-Learning


For this project, each algorithim is analyzed with respect to two different environments:

    Frozen Lake
    Forrest


## Run instructions

    <python3 ./main.py> to run all experiments

## Dependencies

    A list of all dependencies may be found in dep.txt.

    This is obtained from pip -list; not all packages shown may be necessary

## Files Included
    hivemdptoolbox dir 
        - obtained by running <git clone https://github.com/hiive/hiivemdptoolbox>
        - contains useful classes and objects for RL algos on discrete space MDPs

    main.py: main entrypoint.  do ./main to run all exp shown

    policy_iter.py : contains all policy iteration experiments
    value_iter.py : contains all value iteration experiments
    qlearn.py : contains all Q learning experiments

    graphs dir: Contains automatically generated graphs for each experiment

    res.txt: Saved policy and timing metrics for a sample run
